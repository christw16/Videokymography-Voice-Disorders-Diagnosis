# Introduction

   Videokymography is a high-speed medical imaging method to visualize the human vocal fold vibration dynamics. It is a version of a high-speed videolaryngoscopic system. This digital technique for high-speed visualization of vibration, called videokymography, was developed and applied to the vocal folds. Using image processing technique selects one active horizontal line (transverse to the glottis) from the whole laryngeal image. The system makes it possible to observe left-right asymmetries, open quotient, propagation of mucosal waves, movement of the upper and, in the closing phase, the lower margins of the vocal folds, etc. The technique is suitable for further processing and quantification of recorded vibration.
